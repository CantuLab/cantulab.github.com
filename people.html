     <h6>Abraham Morales-Cruz</h6>PhD Student (GGHA) </br>
     <br>
     Abraham is a PhD student in the Horticulture and Agronomy Graduate Group. He is interested in using genomics and bioinformatics to understand the interaction between plants and fungal pathogens. In the Cantu lab he studies the mechanisms of virulence underlying grapevine trunk diseases caused by fungal pathogens. Abraham received his B.S. in Biotechnology Engineering from the Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica in 2012. Before joining the Cantu lab in 2013, he worked at the Seed Biotechnology Center at UC Davis. At SBC he conducted research on pepper genomics, focusing on the discovery of genes associated with a major QTL of capsaicinoid biosynthesis.

     <h6>Jerry Lin</h6>MSc Student (VENGG)</br>
     <br>
     Jerry is a Masters student in the Viticulture & Enology Graduate Group. He received his bachelor’s degrees in Genetics & Plant Biology and Molecular Toxicology at UC Berkeley. A lifelong love of plants and fungi led Jerry to pursue viticulture at UC Davis, where he joined the Cantu lab in the fall of 2015. At the Cantu lab, he is developing techniques for genetic transformation of fungi responsible for grapevine trunk diseases. He is interested in using genetic knockouts and transformants to study the biology of pathogenic fungi as they grow and interact with their hosts.

     <h6>Bárbara Blanco-Ulate</h6>Postdoc</br>
     <br>
     Bárbara earned her undergraduate degree in Biotechnology Engineering from the Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica. During her PhD under the supervision of Drs. Powell and Labavitch Barbara made interesting discoveries on how susceptibility to pathogens is regulated during tomato fruit ripening. In the Cantu Lab Barbara's research focuses on studying the impact of microbial pathogens on plant metabolism by integrating transcriptional and metabolic data.

     <h6>Mélanie Massonnet</h6>Postdoc</br>
     <br>
     Mélanie received her undergraduate bachelor's degree in Plant Physiology from the Université François Rabelais-Tours in France. After a first year of master degree in Plant biology and biotechnologies (Bordeaux, France), she earned a master degree in Enology, Viticulture and Wine producing at the Institut de la Vigne et du Vin (Bordeaux, France) where she conducted research on the functional characterization of O-methyltransferases involved in methoxypyrazines biosynthesis in Vitis vinifera in the lab of Pr. Serge Delrot. Then, she joined Pr. Mario Pezzotti’s lab (Università degli studi di Verona, Italy) where she obtained her PhD in applied biotechnologies, carrying out the berry transcriptome comparison of ten Italian grapevine varieties using RNA-Seq technology. In the Cantu lab, Mélanie investigates the interaction between grapevine and Neofusicoccum parvum, an aggressive trunk pathogen.

	 <h6>Rosa Figueroa-Balderas</h6> Senior Research Scientist </br>
     <br>
     Rosa Figueroa-Balderas completed her Ph.D. in Biochemical Sciences at the Institute of Biotechnology in the National University of México (IBT-UNAM). She joined PIPRA/UCDavis in 2007 with an UCMexus-Conacyt  postdoctoral fellowship to develop marker-free transformation technologies to genetically improve crops of significance to California. Throughout her postdoctoral training at UCDavis, Rosa designed and built complex plant transformation vectors with maximum freedom-to-operate to generate marker-free plants. She has collaborated with several Ag-companies designing plant transformation vectors and developing molecular characterization of thousands of independent transformation events with pre-commercial purposes.

	<h6>Zirou Ye</h6> Research assistant </br>
     	<br>
    Zirou is a senior international student from China. She has been a volunteer of an environmental protection NGO since 1998. In 2012 she was admitted by UC Davis Environmental Science and Management major. Then, her interest toward plant science and wine made her start learning Viticulture and Enology and she finally transferred to a double VEN and Economics major. She joined the Cantu lab at the end of 2013, where she works on grape pathogen projects.

	<h6>Gabrielle (Ella) Allenbeck</h6> Research assistant </br>
     	<br>
    Ella is a sophomore in the Viticulture and Enology program. While the enology side of the major originally attracted her to it, she found her true passion in plant science and plant pathology, directing her towards the viticulture side. Her participation in the University Honors Program lead her to the Cantu lab in search of research opportunities. She joined the lab in the spring of 2015, and works with Abraham Morales-Cruz on deep sequencing techniques of fungal trunk pathogens.
