     <h6>Abraham Morales-Cruz</h6>Junior Specialist</br>
     <br>
     Abraham received his B.S. in Biotechnology Engineering from the Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica in 2012. Before joining the Cantu lab in 2013, Abraham worked at the Seed Biotechnology Center at UC Davis. At SBC he conducted research on pepper genomics, focusing on the discovery of genes associated with a major QTL of capsaicinoid biosynthesis. He is interested in genetics and bioinformatics. In the Cantu lab he works on pathogenomics of grapevine diseases while helping in other lab projects.

     <h6>Laura Jones</h6>MSc student in Viticulture and Enology</br>
     <br>
     Laura received her bachelor's degree in biology from Pepperdine University in 2006. She then joined a research group at Children's Hospital Los Angeles where she studied mother-to-child transmission of HIV, working to identify the unique genetic and functional signatures of HIV variants transmitted in utero or during breastfeeding. After several years in a hospital research setting, her intersecting passions for wine and biology led her to take her scientific skills to wineries in Napa Valley and New Zealand, where she served as the vintage lab technician and learned the ins and outs of winery operation during harvest. Laura joined the UC Davis Viticulture and Enology Master's program in the fall of 2012. Her thesis work in the Cantu Lab focuses on characterizing grapevine defense responses from a novel source of genetic resistance to powdery mildew.

     <h6>Bárbara Blanco-Ulate</h6>Postdoc</br>
     <br>
     Bárbara earned her undergraduate degree in Biotechnology Engineering from the Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica. During her PhD under the supervision of Drs. Powell and Labavitch Barbara made interesting discoveries on how susceptibility to pathogens is regulated during tomato fruit ripening. In the Cantu Lab Barbara's research focuses on studying the impact of microbial pathogens on plant metabolism by integrating transcriptional and metabolic data.

	<h6>Katherine Amrine</h6> Postdoc </br>
     	<br>
     Katie received her undergraduate bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Molecular Biology from the University of Wyoming in 2008 where she conducted research identifying elevated positive selection in Embryophyte lineages in the lab of Dr. David Liberles. She then went directly to the University of California, Merced where she obtained her PhD in Quantitative and Systems Biology in the lab of Dr. David Ardell developing statistical methods to quantify system interactions during protein translation identifying phylogenetic signal. In the Cantu Lab, Katie applies genomics and bioinformatics to investigate the disease resistance networks of grapevine and the mechanisms of pathogenicity of fungal pathogens of grapevines.     </div>
