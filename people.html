     <h6>Abraham Morales-Cruz</h6>Postdoc
     <br>
     In 2012, Abraham joined the Seed Biotechnology Center at UC Davis to conduct research on pepper genomics, studying candidate genes in the biosynthesis of capsaicinoids. This work served as the undergraduate thesis project and final requirement to obtain his B.S. in Biotechnology Engineering at the Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica. From 2013 to 2014 Abraham worked in Cantu lab as a Junior Specialist, where he was instrumental in setting up the lab, and contributed to the implementation of protocols for DNA and RNA extraction and library preparation for sequencing. In the following 3 years and 6 months he completed his Ph.D. in Horticulture and Agronomy under Dr. Cantu’s supervision, with a doctoral dissertation on comparative genomics of grapevine trunk pathogens. During his Ph.D. he developed the first genome assemblies and transcriptomes of multiple species, laying the ground work for utilizing genomics as a tool to understand how these devastating pathogens cause disease.  He developed a method to correctly quantify these pathogens under field conditions using a metagenomics approach, and explored the evolutionary insights of the intra-species genomic variability of the causal agent of Eutypa Dieback. As postdoc in the Cantu lab, Abraham is now the leading bioinformatician for a project funded by MARS Incorporated, focused on the improvement on the genomic resources of the most devastating cacao disease agents in the world.

     <br>
     Mélanie received her undergraduate bachelor's degree in Plant Physiology from the Université François Rabelais-Tours in France. After a first year of master degree in Plant biology and biotechnologies (Bordeaux, France), she earned a master degree in Enology and Viticulture at the Institut de la Vigne et du Vin (Bordeaux, France) where she conducted research on the functional characterization of grape O-methyltransferases involved in methoxypyrazines biosynthesis in the lab of Pr. Serge Delrot. Then, she joined Pr. Mario Pezzotti’s lab (Università degli studi di Verona, Italy) where she obtained her PhD in Applied biotechnologies, carrying out the berry transcriptome comparison of ten Italian grapevine varieties using RNAseq technology. Since her arrival in 2016 in the Cantu lab, Mélanie has investigated the interaction between grapevine and trunk pathogens and has studied the genomic variability in the Esca pathogen <i>Phaeoacremonium minimum</i>. She is currently reconstructing and comparing the transcriptomes of grape accessions that carry different genetic resistance genes to powdery mildew.

     <h6>Amanda Vondras</h6>Postdoc
     <br>
     Amanda received a BS in Biology from Cornell University in 2011 and PhD in Molecular and Cellular Biology from Oregon State University in 2017. As an undergraduate student, she pursued the functional characterization of an enzyme suspected to be involved in norisoprenoid biosynthesis. Her doctoral work included studying uneven berry ripening and the effects of grape leafroll-associated virus 3 on ripening. As a postdoc in the Cantu Lab, she will delve more deeply into this plant-pathogen relationship by exploring how combinations of viral infections influence the severity of symptoms during ripening and alter plant defense responses.

In 2007, she was awarded a UCMexus-Conacyt postdoctoral fellowship where she developed marker-free transformation technologies to genetically improve California relevant crops at PIPRA/UC Davis. Throughout her postdoctoral training at UC Davis, Rosa designed and built complex plant transformation vectors with maximum freedom-to-operate with the aim of generating marker-free plants. She has collaborated with several Ag-companies designing plant transformation vectors and developing molecular characterization of thousands of independent transformation events with pre-commercial purposes. Rosa has been working in Cantu’s lab since December, 2014 primarily on the development, optimization and implementation of molecular biology protocols for grapevine genomic studies related to grape genetic resistance to Pierce’s disease, powdery mildew and Neofusicoccum parvum, as well as in grape whole genome projects.
