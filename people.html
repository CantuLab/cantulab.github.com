     <br>
     Brianna is a graduate student in the Plant Biology Graduate Group. She earned her Bachelor's degree in Genetics from the University of Wisconsin. At the UW she studied the disease virulence of Ralastonia solanacearum on tobacco and tomato plants. This lead to her research interests in determining the role genetics has on plant-microbe interactions.   Since joining the Cantu lab in spring of 2017, she has been investigating the induction of the anthocyanin pathway in white berries by Noble Rot infection.

     <h6>Mélanie Massonnet</h6>Postdoc</br>
     <br>
     Mélanie received her undergraduate bachelor's degree in Plant Physiology from the Université François Rabelais-Tours in France. After a first year of master degree in Plant biology and biotechnologies (Bordeaux, France), she earned a master degree in Enology, Viticulture and Wine producing at the Institut de la Vigne et du Vin (Bordeaux, France) where she conducted research on the functional characterization of O-methyltransferases involved in methoxypyrazines biosynthesis in Vitis vinifera in the lab of Pr. Serge Delrot. Then, she joined Pr. Mario Pezzotti’s lab (Università degli studi di Verona, Italy) where she obtained her PhD in applied biotechnologies, carrying out the berry transcriptome comparison of ten Italian grapevine varieties using RNA-Seq technology. In the Cantu lab, Mélanie investigates the interaction between grapevine and Neofusicoccum parvum, an aggressive trunk pathogen.

     <h6>Andrea Minio</h6>Postdoc</br>
     <br>
     Andrea earned a master degree in Bioengineering at Università degli Studi di Padova (Italy) under the supervision of prof. Di Camillo studying the topological properties of gene co-regulatory networks reconstructed by reverse egineering expression profiles. In Prof. Massimo Delledonne's lab he received his Ph.D in Applied Biotechnologies at  Università di Verona (Italy) focusing on de novo reconstruction and annotation of genomes and transcriptomes. As bioinformatician in the Cantu Lab, Andrea applies computational methods to sequencing data with the purpose of uncover complex genomic characteristics and lifestyle of grapevine cultivar, fungal phytopathogens and other non model species.

     <h6>Amanda Vondras</h6>Postdoc</br>
     <br>
     Amanda received a BS in Biology from Cornell University in 2011 and PhD in Molecular and Cellular Biology from Oregon State University in 2017. As an undergraduate student, she pursued the functional characterization of an enzyme suspected to be involved in norisoprenoid biosynthesis. Her doctoral work included studying uneven berry ripening and the effects of grape leafroll-associated virus 3 on ripening. As a postdoc in the Cantu Lab, she will delve more deeply into this plant-pathogen relationship by exploring how combinations of viral infections influence the severity of symptoms during ripening and alter plant defense responses.

	 <h6>Rosa Figueroa-Balderas</h6> Senior Research Scientist </br>
     <br>
     Rosa Figueroa-Balderas completed her M.S. and Ph.D. in Biochemical Sciences at the Institute of Biotechnology in the National University of Mexico (IBT-UNAM). In 2007, she was awarded a UCMexus-Conacyt postdoctoral fellowship where she developed marker-free transformation technologies to genetically improve California relevant crops at PIPRA/UC Davis. Throughout her postdoctoral training at UC Davis, Rosa designed and built complex plant transformation vectors with maximum freedom-to-operate with the aim of generating marker-free plants. She has collaborated with several Ag-companies designing plant transformation vectors and developing molecular characterization of thousands of independent transformation events with pre-commercial purposes. Rosa has been working in Cantu’s lab since December, 2014 primarily on the development, optimization and implementation of molecular biology protocols for grapevine genomic studies related to grape genetic resistance to Pierce’s disease, powdery mildew and Neofusicoccum parvum, as well as in grape whole genome projects.

As an undergraduate student, he interned in the laboratory of Dr. David Gilchrist where he conducted research in the development of transformation vectors for Pierce’s Disease resistance in Vitis Vinifera cultivars. After graduation, Eric worked for an analytical laboratory in Napa County where he conducted molecular microbiology diagnostics on wine and grape berries. He also worked for two large agricultural companies where he was involved in molecular-breeding and plant pathology projects related to improving vegetable crop genetic resistance against plant diseases. In the Cantu lab, Eric will assist members of the lab in research on the genetics and molecular biology of grapevine responses to microbial pathogens, as well as research related to grape genomics.
